    <h1> Harry styles</h1>
   
  <p>(Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you)<br>

Holdin' me back<br>
Gravity's holdin' me back<br>
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand<br>
Why don't we leave it at that?,br>

Nothin' to say<br>
When everything gets in the way<br>
Seems you cannot be replaced<br>
And I'm the one who will stay, oh, oh, oh<br>

In this world, it's just us<br>
You know it's not the same as it was<br>
In this world, it's just us<br>
You know it's not the same as it was<br>
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same<br>

Answer the phone<br>
Harry, you're no good alone<br>
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?<br>
What kind of pills are you on?<br>

Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help <br>
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh, oh, oh<br>

In this world, it's just us <br>
You know it's not the same as it was <br>
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was <br>
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same <br>

   </P>
